Invalid directory: if passed a string that isnâ€™t a directory name, the program will print an error message and exit.

No directory passed: if not passed a directory name, the program will print an error message and exit.

Some empty, some nonempty files: if some files are empty and some files are nonempty, all files will be treated the same in analysis.

Files and directories: if passed valid files and directories, it will create a thread for every directory and file, tokenize files, join threads, and analyze token lists and output results between pairs of files in order of increasing combined token count.

Identical files: if passed at least two files with the same text body (not case sensitive and excluding non-alphabet characters besides hyphens), the outputted distance between the files will be 0.

Files with the same token count: if multiple pairs of files have the same combined token count, the order in which they are output will not matter.
